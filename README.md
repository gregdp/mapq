* An important note if using Google Drive: when calculating Q-scores with multiple processes, the process fails if the map and model files are on a Google Drive path. Please copy them to a non Google Drive location for this to work.
* A video that shows how to genreate a color key for displaying Q-scores on a model ribbon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxy3reAXLKI
